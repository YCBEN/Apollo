# Port Scanner 🔍

This repository is part of the **Apollo Cybersecurity Series**.  
It contains the step-by-step development of a Python-based Port Scanner, evolving from a simple tool into a powerful scanner.

## 📌 Stages

- Basic single-port check using sockets
- Scan a range of ports
- Identify services running on open ports
- Command-line arguments for flexibility
- Multi-threading for faster scans
- Banner grabbing for service info
- Save results to file (txt/JSON)
- Advanced scanning techniques

## 🎯 Purpose

- Document the evolution of a port scanner
- Build practical skills in Python networking and cybersecurity
- Provide a clear learning path for others to follow
