Apollo is my main repository for a series of **cybersecurity projects**.  
Each project is a practical exercise designed to strengthen my skills in network security, SOC analysis, and vulnerability management.

## 📌 Projects

- **SOC Log Analyzer** → Detect anomalies and patterns in system logs
- **Vulnerability Manager** → Track and prioritize vulnerabilities

## 🎯 Purpose

- Build a portfolio of hands-on cybersecurity tools
- Document my learning journey step by step
- Share open-source projects with the community

## 🔮 Roadmap

Apollo will continue to grow with new projects, including:

- Automation scripts
- Threat detection utilities
- Security analysis tools
